- Safas spend the most time on screens yet we have one of the worst economies and level of unemployment in the world.
- The reason - we are consuming rather than creating.
- Thoughts about this.
- Also - why does it only seem to be getting air time now rather than when this study was released? At least that's my perspective on it. I'd only recently heard about this on the radio. I hadn't heard about it before.

A guide to quickly get the Jekyll Verdant theme up and running.

<!--end_excerpt-->

The theme utilizes Docker Compose to run a container built from the necessary image for local development. This means you just need to use one command to get it running locally.

Ensure you have *Docker* installed. You will also need a container management tool installed such as *Docker Desktop* or *Rancher Desktop*.

Run the following command: `Docker Compose Up`

When the container is running navigate to [Jekyll Verdant](http://localhost:4000/Jekyll-Theme-Verdant/) in your browser.
